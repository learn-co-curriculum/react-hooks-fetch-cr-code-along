# React Fetch CRUD Codealong (Create and Read)

## Learning Goals

- Write `fetch` requests for `GET` and `POST`
- Initiate `fetch` requests with the `useEffect` hook
- Initiate `fetch` requests from user events
- Update state and trigger a re-render after receiving a response to the `fetch` request
- Perform Create and Read (CRUD) actions on arrays in state

## Introduction

In labs and technical lessons up to this point, we've seen how to use `fetch` in a React application for some common single-page application patterns, such as:

- Requesting data from a server when our application first loads
- Requesting data from a server on a button click

In both of those cases, our workflow in React follows a similar pattern:

- When X event occurs (_our application loads_, _a user clicks a button_)
- Make Y fetch request (_GET_)
- Update Z state (_add all items to state_)

In this codealong lesson, we'll get more practice following this pattern to
build out our next CRUD action - Create - to work with both our **server-side** data (the
database; in our case, the `db.json` file) as well as our **client-side** data
(our React state). We'll be working on a shopping list application, using `json-server` to create a RESTful API which we
can interact with from React by using fetch and HTTP requests.

## Instructions

To get started, let's install our dependencies:

```console
$ npm install
```

Then, to run `json-server`, we'll be using the `server` script in the
`package.json` file:

```console
$ npm run server
```

This will run `json-server` on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
Before moving ahead, open
[http://localhost:4000/items](http://localhost:4000/items) in the browser and
familiarize yourself with the data. What are the important keys on each object?

Leave `json-server` running. Open a new terminal, and run React with:

```console
$ npm run dev
```

View the application in the browser at
[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). We don't have any data to
display yet, but eventually, we'll want to display the list of items from
`json-server` in our application and be able to perform CRUD actions on them.

Take some time now to familiarize yourself with the components in the
`src/components` folder. Which components are stateful and why? What does our
component hierarchy look like?

Once you've familiarized yourself with the starter code, let's start building
out some features!

### Displaying Items

Our first goal will be to display a list of items from the server when the
application first loads. Let's see how this goal fits into this common pattern
for working with server-side data in React:

- When X event occurs (_our application loads_)
- Make Y fetch request (_GET /items_)
- Update Z state (_add all items to state_)

With that structure in mind, our first step is to **identify which component
triggers this event**. In this case, the event isn't triggered by a user
interacting with a specific DOM element. We want to initiate the fetch request
without making our users click a button or anything like that.

So the event we're looking for is a **side-effect** of a component being
rendered. Which component? Well, we can make that determination by looking at
which state we're trying to update. In our case, it's the `items` state which is
held in the `ShoppingList` component.

We can call the `useEffect` hook in the `ShoppingList` component to initiate our
`fetch` request. Let's start by using `console.log` to ensure that our syntax is
correct, and that we're fetching data from the server:

```jsx
// src/components/ShoppingList.js

// import useEffect
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
// ...rest of imports

function ShoppingList() {
  const [selectedCategory, setSelectedCategory] = useState("All");
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);

  // Add useEffect hook
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("http://localhost:4000/items")
      .then(r => {
        if (r.ok) {
          return r.json()
        } else {
          console.log("fetch request failed")
        }
      })
      .then(items => console.log(items))
      .catch(error => console.log(error))
  }, []);

  // ...rest of component
}
```

Check your console in the browser — you should see an **array of objects**
representing each item in our shopping list.

Now all that's left to do is to update state, so that React will re-render our
components and use the new data to display our shopping list. Our goal here is
to replace our current `items` state, which is an empty array, with the new
array from the server:

```jsx
// src/components/ShoppingList.js

function ShoppingList() {
  const [selectedCategory, setSelectedCategory] = useState("All");
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);

    // Update state by passing the array of items to setItems  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("http://localhost:4000/items")
      .then(r => {
        if (r.ok) {
          return r.json()
        } else {
          console.log("fetch request failed")
        }
      })
      .then(items => setItems(items))
      .catch(error => console.log(error))
  }, []);

  // ...rest of component
}
```

Check your work in the browser and make sure you see the list of items. Which
component is responsible for rendering each item from the list of items in
state?

To recap:

- When X event occurs
  - Use the `useEffect` hook to trigger a side-effect in the `ShoppingList`
    component after the component first renders
- Make Y fetch request
  - Make a `GET` request to `/items` to retrieve a list of items
- Update Z state
  - Replace our current list of items with the new list

### Creating Items

Our next goal will be to add a new item to our database on the server when a
user submits the form. Once again, let's plan out our steps:

- When X event occurs (_a user submits the form_)
- Make Y fetch request (_POST /items with the new item data_)
- Update Z state (_add a new item to state_)

To tackle the first step, we'll need to **identify which component triggers the
event**. In this case, the form in question is in the `ItemForm` component.
Let's start by handling the form `submit` event in this component and access
the data from the form inputs, which are saved in state:

```jsx
// src/components/ItemForm.js

function ItemForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [category, setCategory] = useState("Produce");

  // Add function to handle submissions
  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log("name:", name);
    console.log("category:", category);
  }

  return (
    // Set up the form to call handleSubmit when the form is submitted
    <form className="NewItem" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {/** ...form inputs here */}
    </form>
  );
}
```

One step down, two to go! Next, we need to determine what data needs to be sent
to the server with our `fetch` request. Our goal is to create a new item, and it
should have the same structure as other items on the server. So we'll need to
send an object that looks like this:

```json
{
  "name": "Yogurt",
  "category": "Dairy",
  "isInCart": false
}
```

Let's create this item in our `handleSubmit` function using the data from the
form state:

```js
// src/components/ItemForm.js

function handleSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  const itemData = {
    name: name,
    category: category,
    isInCart: false,
  };
  console.log(itemData);
}
```

Check your work in the browser again and make sure you are able to log an item
to the console that has the right key/value pairs. Now, on to the `fetch`!

```js
function handleSubmit(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  const itemData = {
    name: name,
    category: category,
    isInCart: false,
  };
  fetch("http://localhost:4000/items", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(itemData),
  })
    .then(r => {
      if (r.ok) {
        return r.json()
      } else {
        console.log("item failed to create")
      }
    })
    .then(newItem => console.log(newItem))
    .catch(error => console.log("error"))
}
```

Recall that to make a `POST` request, we must provide additional options along
with the URL when calling `fetch`: the `method` (HTTP verb), the `headers`
(specifying that we are sending a JSON string in the request), and the `body`
(the stringified object we are sending). If you need a refresher on this syntax,
check out the [MDN article on Using Fetch][using fetch].

Try submitting the form once more. You should now see a new item logged to the
console that includes an `id` attribute from the server. You can also verify the
object was persisted by refreshing the page in the browser and seeing the new
item at the bottom of the shopping list.

However, our goal isn't to make our users refresh the page to see their newly
created item — we want it to show up as soon as it's been persisted. So we have
one more step left: **updating state**.

For this final step, we need to consider:

- Which component owns the state that we're trying to update?
- How can we get the data from the `ItemForm` component to the component that
  owns state?
- How do we correctly update state?

For the first question, we're trying to update state in the `ShoppingList`
component. Our goal is to display the new item in the list alongside the other
items, and this is the component that is responsible for that part of our
application. Since the `ShoppingList` component is a **parent** component to the
`ItemForm` component, we'll need to **pass a callback function as a prop** so
that the `ItemForm` component can send the new item up to the `ShoppingList`.

Let's add a `handleAddItem` function to `ShoppingList`, and pass a reference to
that function as a prop called `onAddItem` to the `ItemForm`:

```jsx
// src/components/ShoppingList.js

function ShoppingList() {
  const [selectedCategory, setSelectedCategory] = useState("All");
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("http://localhost:4000/items")
      .then(r => {
        if (r.ok) {
          return r.json()
        } else {
          console.log("fetch request failed")
        }
      })
      .then(items => setItems(items))
      .catch(error => console.log(error))
  }, []);

  // add this function!
  function handleAddItem(newItem) {
    console.log("In ShoppingList:", newItem);
  }

  function handleCategoryChange(category) {
    setSelectedCategory(category);
  }

  const itemsToDisplay = items.filter((item) => {
    if (selectedCategory === "All") return true;

    return item.category === selectedCategory;
  });

  return (
    <div className="ShoppingList">
      {/* add the onAddItem prop! */}
      <ItemForm onAddItem={handleAddItem} />
      <Filter
        category={selectedCategory}
        onCategoryChange={handleCategoryChange}
      />
      <ul className="Items">
        {itemsToDisplay.map((item) => (
          <Item key={item.id} item={item} />
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Then, we can use this prop in the `ItemForm` to send the new item **up** to the
`ShoppingList` when we receive a response from the server:

```jsx
// src/components/ItemForm.js

// destructure the onAddItem prop
function ItemForm({ onAddItem }) {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [category, setCategory] = useState("Produce");

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const itemData = {
      name: name,
      category: category,
      isInCart: false,
    };
    fetch("http://localhost:4000/items", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(itemData),
    })
      .then(r => {
        if (r.ok) {
          return r.json()
        } else {
          console.log("item failed to create")
        } 
      })
      // call the onAddItem prop with the newItem
      .then(newItem => onAddItem(newItem))
      .catch(error => console.log(error))
  }

  // ...rest of component
}
```

Check your work by submitting the form once more. You should now see the new
item logged to the console, this time from the `ShoppingList` component. We're
getting close! For the last step, we need to call `setState` with a new array
that has our new item at the end. Recall from our lessons on working with arrays
in state that we can use the spread operator to perform this action:

```js
// src/components/ShoppingList.js

function handleAddItem(newItem) {
  setItems([...items, newItem]);
}
```

Now each time a user submits the form, a new item will be added to our database
and will also be added to our client-side state, so that the user will
immediately see their item in the list.

Let's recap our steps here:

- When X event occurs
  - When a user submits the `ItemForm`, handle the form submit event and access
    data from the form using state
- Make Y fetch request
  - Make a `POST` request to `/items`, passing the form data in the **body** of
    the request, and access the newly created item in the response
- Update Z state
  - Send the item from the fetch response to the `ShoppingList` component, and
    set state by creating a new array with our current items from state, plus
    the new item at the end

## Conclusion

Synchronizing state between a client-side application and a server-side
application is a challenging problem! Thankfully, the general steps to
accomplish this in React are the same regardless of what kind of action we are
performing:

- When X event occurs
- Make Y fetch request
- Update Z state

Keep these steps in mind any time you're working on a feature involving
synchronizing client and server state. Once you have this general framework, you
can apply the other things you've learned about React to each step, like
handling events, updating state, and passing data between components.
